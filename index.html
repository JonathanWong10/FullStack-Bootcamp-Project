                <p>Hello, I am Jonathan Wong, 27years old. You can find my professional background and hobbies as you keep going through my blog page.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

          <p>Starting with my main focus on professional background (as per below), you can find my educational background, where I started my career and what I am currently doing.</p>
          <p>You can find my hobbies after going through my professional pathway.</p>

          <h3>Professional Background</h3>
          <p>Starting with my educational background, I did my bachelor's degree in Bcom Tourism, Hospitality and Marketing at Curtin. However, I recently ddecided to have a career change to IT, thus started a bootcamp at Coder Faculty in Full-Stack development.</p>
          <p>
            I started my career at Lai Fat Fur & Bros Co. Ltd in accounting department, with my main duty was book keeping.
            <br><br>
            Later on, I went to ITSolvz as an indoor sales representative, where I help customers to have their needs met in any hardwares, such as PCs and printers. 
            <br><br>
            While trying to consider what I really wanted to do, I came across Infosys, who recruits graduates even without IT background. At that moment, I seize this opportunity to join Infosys, and did have a training in Java and SQL.

                  <p>I have developped this passion late in my teen years, around 17 years old, and started to play as a striker. However, I transitioned to attacking midfield and Left Winger later on. Hope we can see each other on the pitch one day</p>
